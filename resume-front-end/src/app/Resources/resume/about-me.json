    "content": "Currently, I am a student at the University of Georgia, studying mathematics, with a computer science minor, with the end goal of becoming a software engineer. Since college started for me, programming has become my passion, and my primary way to spend free time. I love the creativity of designing websites and apps people can interact with, but as a math minded person, I also am looking to make a difference in developing tools for developers, mainly programming languages. On the topic of language, UGA gave me a thorough introduction to the Russian language, and after spending time in Armenia and Georgia, I have a new solidified appreciation for language, this undoubtedly being one of the reasons I have goals to help write or maintain programming languages. Additionally, I am a huge car guy and love to work on cars, my car being a 2013 subaru BRZ (as seen in the future picture), and I also love to play the piano, as I played it all throughout high school, and am working on getting back into my former musical shape."
