    "content": "As a rising Junior in college, I am digging even deeper into finding an Internship in the software development industry. With 3.5 years of experience in web development, 1 year experience in iOS development, and 1 year experience in C / C++ writing bytecode compilers and interpreters, I am looking for an environment to challenge me, while working with a team to deliver incredible software products. I am currently focusing on iOS development with Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, CoreData, and SwiftData, as well as learning how to write compilers and interpreters to start contributing to Swift, V8, or another language depending on which tools I end up primarily using."
